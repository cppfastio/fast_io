Copyright Â© cppfastio 2025

1. License Grant
This software is provided under the Anti-Tivo License (ATL), allowing unrestricted commercial use without requiring source code disclosure, except under specific conditions outlined in Section 2.

2. Restrictions on Tivoized Hardware
Any device using this software must comply with the following:

If the device includes an app store, it must allow users to install modified versions of this software without restrictions.

Manufacturers must not use cryptographic signatures, hardware verification, or other technical measures to prevent users from modifying and reinstalling the software.

If a device does not meet these conditions, the software must be licensed under GPLv3, ensuring full compliance with open-source principles.

3. Prioritization of Cross-Platform Technologies
When PWA (Progressive Web Applications) or Wine and other cross-platform technologies are available, developers and vendors should prioritize their use to maintain openness and portability.

If a platform deliberately undermines open internet access (e.g., restricting the use of Progressive Web Applications (PWA) through a closed framework), then all software on that platform must be licensed under GPLv3, ensuring users have full modification and installation rights.

4. Exceptions
The following categories of devices are exempt from Sections 2 and 3 and may use this software without modification requirements:

Medical Equipment: Devices used for life support, diagnostics, or critical healthcare applications.

Automotive Systems: Software used in autonomous driving, vehicle control, or safety-critical functions.

5. Enforcement & Non-Mandatory Action
The copyright holder reserves the right to enforce this license but is not obligated to do so.

Enforcement actions may be taken against entities violating Section 2 or Section 3, particularly those engaging in Tivoization or deliberate internet restrictions.

This license is not subject to any government control, including but not limited to the United States government.

6. Liability Disclaimer
This software is provided "as is", without warranties of any kind. The author is not liable for any damages resulting from its use.
